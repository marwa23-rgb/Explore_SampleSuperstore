# Explore_SampleSuperstore analysis
Explore_SampleSuperstore is a data analysis project that explores the SampleSuperstore dataset, a dataset from Kaggle that contains sales and profit data for a superstore. The goal of the project is to gain insights into the data, identify patterns, and detect anomalies.

The project begins with an initial data exploration to understand the structure and contents of the dataset. This is done using commands like head(), info(), and describe() in Python. Once the dataset is understood, the project checks for any missing values or duplicates. Any missing values are handled and duplicate rows are removed.

Next, the project uses data visualization to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset. This is done using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create various types of plots, such as bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms. Examples of data visualizations that the project might create include:

A count plot showing Count Sub-Category sales
A bar chart showing sub-categories by profit
A count plot showing Count Category sales
A bar chart showing sales by region
A joint plot showing the relationship between Discount and profit
A count plot showing the Count Ship Mode used
A scatter plot visualizing the relationship between sales and profit
A histogram showing the distribution of profit values
The project also examines the correlation between numerical variables to understand how they relate to each other. This is done using the correlation matrix and plotting it as a heatmap.

Finally, the project summarizes the findings of the analysis and discusses the implications for the superstore. This might include identifying the most profitable products and regions or identifying areas where the supermarket can improve its performance.

## Problems:
### 1] Total Profit generated by Furniture is very low.
### 2] Total Profit generated by the Office Supplies is moderate.
### 3] The number of items doesn't impact the Profits generated. This means the profit generated per item is not consistent.
### 4] The discount given for the items also, doesn't affect any more profits.
### 5] Some states have negative Mean Profits, i.e., no profits!
## Solutions:
### 1] It's necessary to increase the sales of the Furniture to generate more profits.
### 2] Increase the profits generated by Office Supplies using a better recommendation system to accompany when a consumer buys Furniture or Technology-related items.
### 3] Regulating the proper prices to make better profits as the number of items increases.
### 4] the discounts should be properly manipulated when there is an increase in the number of items.
### 5] Increase the profits in these states: ['Ohio', 'Colorado', 'North Carolina', 'Tennessee', 'Pennsylvania', 'Texas', 'Illinois', 'Arizona', 'Oregon', 'Florida']
